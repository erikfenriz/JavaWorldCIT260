 Control Help Menu
To progress through the game, use the keys that are
prompted by the game.
The game is expecting the commands as numbers – 1,2,3,4,5,etc.
In some cases, the commands that the game expects are “yes”
and “no” for closed-ended questions.
Some screens wouldn’t prompt an input.
These screens are skippable with Space button
